##  GRAPH-CONSTRAINED DIFFUSION FOR END-TO-END PATH PLANNING

### Abstract

Think of Google Maps, which usually finds the shortest or fastest route. But people don’t always take the most “optimal” route, they might prefer to avoid traffic, stick to familiar roads, or pass by their favorite chai shop. Traditional systems which involve explicit optimization, that is, using predefined rules to compute the shortest or fastest route, struggle to understand these hidden preferences. This paper introduces GDP, a data-driven path-planning model that learns from real-world travel patterns. Instead of rigidly following shortest-path algorithms, “it uses a novel diffusion process that incorporates constraints from road networks, and plans paths as conditional path generation given the origin and destination as prior evidence”. The paper boasts 14.2% ~ 43.5% improvement over strong baselines on real-world datasets. In our project we will attempt to reproduce results in this given range.
